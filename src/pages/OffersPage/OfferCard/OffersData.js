Plus, rather than explore independently—and having to arrange travel between the two sites—you get a guide for extra insight and convenient transport laid on.

It is at the back of the building with a nice balcony (with double-glazed windows) overlooking a small plaza, so it was quiet. Comfortable bed and good sleeping at night after long days in this exciting city. It had everything I needed and I felt like I was in a comfortable, very pleasant nest in the middle of everything that Madrid has to offer. The owner was most gracious and helpful. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a fantastic place to stay in Madrid.",
